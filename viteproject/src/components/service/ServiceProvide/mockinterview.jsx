        the conversation.
        <br />
        2. <strong>Realistic Scenarios:</strong> The mock interviews are
        designed to replicate the actual visa interview environment as closely
        as possible. This includes the types of questions, the demeanor of the
        interviewer, and the overall atmosphere. This preparation helps you feel
        more comfortable and less anxious during the actual interview.
        <br />
        3. <strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> Our experts provide detailed
        feedback following the mock interview. This feedback is based on your
        performance, highlighting your strengths and identifying areas that
